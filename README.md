# GIS deck.gl App - Proof of Concept

- Geo Information System -> Monitoring and Analytics Platform

<!-- 
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
-->

Technical Details:

- Frontend Framework: Vite and React for a fast, responsive, and modern user interface.
- Geospatial Visualization: Deck.gl for high-performance, interactive visualizations.
- Mapping Service: Mapbox GL for dynamic and customizable map rendering.
- Data Management: Integration with real-time data sources to monitor and update data status.


## Hexbin Structure

Using a hexagon grid (Hexbin) for data visualization, particularly in geospatial contexts, has several advantages over using circles or squares. Here are some reasons why hexagon grids are often preferred:

### 1. Uniform Distance Between Centers

Hexagons: In a hexagon grid, the distance between the centers of adjacent hexagons is uniform. This uniformity ensures that each hexagon is equidistant from its neighbors, creating a consistent and visually pleasing pattern.

Squares: While squares also have uniform distances between centers, the diagonal distances are longer than the horizontal and vertical distances, which can lead to inconsistencies in analysis.

Circles: Circles cannot tile a plane without gaps, leading to overlaps or empty spaces, making them less efficient for full coverage.

### 2. Efficient Coverage and Sampling

Hexagons: Hexagons cover an area more efficiently than squares or circles with the same radius. This efficiency means fewer hexagons are needed to cover a given area, reducing computational load and improving performance.

Squares: Squares may require more elements to cover the same area, especially when considering diagonal distances.

Circles: As circles do not tessellate, they either overlap or leave gaps, resulting in inefficient coverage.

### 3. Better Representation of Natural Phenomena

Hexagons: Many natural processes and phenomena (like weather patterns and biological systems) are better represented with hexagonal grids due to their isotropic properties (uniform properties in all directions).

Squares and Circles: These shapes can introduce directional biases, which might distort the representation of the data.

### 4. Visual Appeal and Clarity

Hexagons: Hexagonal grids are visually appealing and provide a clear and continuous representation of the data without introducing directional biases. This visual consistency helps in understanding spatial patterns.

Squares: While easy to implement, squares can create a checkerboard effect, which may distract or confuse the viewer.

Circles: Circles can overlap, creating cluttered visuals that are hard to interpret.

### 5. Minimized Edge Effects

Hexagons: Hexagons minimize the edge effects in data aggregation and analysis, providing a smoother transition between regions.

Squares: Squares can create artifacts at the edges, especially when data points are concentrated along the edges of the squares.

Circles: Circles, due to their non-tessellating nature, create irregular edges, which can lead to significant artifacts.

### 6. Improved Nearest Neighbor Analysis

Hexagons: Each hexagon has six neighbors, providing a more balanced nearest neighbor relationship compared to squares (four neighbors) and offering better local neighborhood analysis.

Squares: Squares have four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) and sometimes consider diagonal neighbors, leading to eight in total, which can complicate the analysis.

Circles: Circles do not have a fixed number of neighbors, making nearest neighbor analysis inconsistent.

While hexagons, squares, and circles each have their use cases, hexagons are often the preferred choice in spatial data visualization due to their efficiency, uniformity, and better representation of natural processes. The advantages in coverage, visual clarity, and minimized edge effects make hexagon grids a robust choice for many geospatial and data visualization applications.
